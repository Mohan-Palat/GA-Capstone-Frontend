## Issues
My main issue was time. I spent more time than I expected to on the backend because I had to teach myself how to use Flask with mongoDB.

Another issue I had was using npm. I don't know exactly what happened, but I think I made a typo while installing some dependencies.

## Future enhancments
- Add styling
- Add redirection
- A login page
- Refactoring with Redux
- A Search page to generate custom queries to send to the backend
- Implement graphs to visually display your performance over time
